How the f@%& does XKB work?
===========================

This question is surprisingly difficult to answer, and documentation is scarce.

XKB the protocol
================

XKB is an extension to the X11 protocol that allows client applications to
query information about the keyboard layout. A keyboard layout from the protocol
is a name referencing a configuration file which is stored somewhere on the host
machine.

XKB the library
===============

There are two libraries for working with XKB:
  - xcb-xkb, as part of xcb
  - xkbcommon

xcb-xkb provides the low-level protocol API. It is probably used internally by
the xkbcommon-x11 module. Client applications usually do not use it much, other
than for selecting device events.

Parsing XKB layouts would be very difficult if it were not for the xkbcommon
library, which abstracts some of the details into three main objects:

  - xkb_keymap, which represents a keyboard layout. This is used to figure out
    which key should be VKFW_KEY_W, etc.
  - xkb_state, which keeps track of modifier state. This is used to translate
    keycodes into keysyms.
  - xkb_compose_state, which keeps track of multi-character sequences. This in
    conjunction with xkb_state is used for text input.
