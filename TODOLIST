Legend:
  - [x] Work-in-progress (please document where)
  - [!] High priority task
  - [ ] Normal priority task
  - ( ) Low priority task

==========

  - [ ] Mouse grabbing and relative pointer movement

  - ( ) Full screen

Backends
==========

  - [!] Implement Win32 backend (I will probably work on this from my school
        computer lmao)
  - ( ) Implement Wayland backend (this is presumably more painful than the
        Win32 API, which is why it is low priority)
