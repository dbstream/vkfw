==========
VKFW
==========

VKFW is a framework for window creation, event handling, and Vulkan graphics
that I'm working on (because I find it fun for some reason).

Current state of the project
============================

VKFW is very early in development and currently only has backends for Linux/X11
that are partially implemented. See TODOLIST and xcb/TODOLIST for more details.

Don't expect any rapid progress on this project -- this is a hobbyist project of
mine.

Documentation
=============

Despite there being a folder named `Documentation/` in this repository, there is
not much documentation other than the VKFW header itself.

> Use the source, Luke!

Versioning
==========

VKFW uses the same major.minor.patch versioning scheme as Vulkan 1.x. VKFW also
bundles the header version it was compiled against to make the full version.
This means that both the VKFW library version and the Vulkan version need to be
checked for support for new features.

If an application calls `vkfwInit()`, as it should, the runtime VKFW version
will be automatically checked against what the application was compiled against.

Code guidelines
===============

- Write readable and efficient code.

- Handle errors nicely.

- Write extensible code.

- Ensure backwards-compatibility.
